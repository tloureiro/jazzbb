# Atlas Feature Outline

## Goals
- unify table rendering between TipTap and Markdown preview
- surface sample templates for tables, outlines, and frontmatter
- ensure autosave hooks respect nested folders inside the vault

## Milestones
1. Enable TipTap table extension (done)
2. Seed table reference note in samples (done)
3. Run cross-browser smoke tests on nested vault folders (next)

## Notes
The Atlas stream shares keyboard shortcut coverage with the base editor; avoid introducing bindings that conflict with Cmd/Ctrl+Shift combos already reserved for sidebar and outline toggles.
