# Midnight Jam Session

This is a sample note that demonstrates how jazzbb treats YAML frontmatter:

- The header metadata stays hidden until you toggle the frontmatter editor (`Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + F`).
- The right-hand panel renders the structured details so you can double-check authorship, tags, or custom fields.
- Editing the YAML overlay immediately updates the parsed summary and persists with the rest of the markdown content.

Feel free to duplicate this note or tweak the metadata fields to match your own vault conventions.
